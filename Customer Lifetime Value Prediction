Customer Lifetime Value Prediction estimates the total revenue a customer is expected to generate during their relationship with a company.
Goals for your project:
Generate or use a synthetic customer transaction dataset (no CSV needed if you want it immediately runnable).
Perform data preprocessing and feature engineering.
Train a regression model (like Linear Regression or Random Forest Regressor) to predict CLV.
Evaluate the model using RMSE, R² score, and visualizations.
Visualize top factors affecting CLV.
