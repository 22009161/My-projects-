**Objective:** Predict customer churn for a telecom company using Python and machine learning.

## Project Overview
This project analyzes customer data to predict whether a customer will leave a telecom company (churn) or stay. It demonstrates **data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning**.

## Tools & Skills
- **Languages & Libraries:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **Techniques:** Data Cleaning, EDA, Classification, Random Forest
- 
## Key Insights
- Customers with longer tenure are less likely to churn
- Contract type and monthly charges are significant predictors
- Random Forest classifier achieved **XX% accuracy** on the test set

## Usage
